# openclaw (personal)

This repository contains the **skills** and **services** I maintain for my OpenClaw setup.

## Layout

- `skills/` – custom OpenClaw skills
- `services/` – small local services used by OpenClaw (e.g. webhook receivers)

## Notes

- Secrets are **not** committed. See `.env.example` files for templates.
- When replying to GitHub issues/PRs via the assistant, append: `— replied by OpenClaw assistant` (configurable).
